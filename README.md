# Skip Lists Implementation in C++
Simple implementation of Skip Lists in C++. Race attendance / movie characters theme.

There are three input files that can be used for prepopulating the skip list list. To change this modify the digit in line 12 of main.cpp:
```
std::string fileName = "prep1.txt";
```

The maximum number of nodes in the skip list is ```100```. To change this modify line 14 in SkipList.h:
```
 const int max_size = 100;
 ```
